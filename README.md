# XStream Project

The Xstream Project is an open-source initiative designed to gather and analyze data from multiple crypto chains. By leveraging cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, data streaming, and analytics tools, Xstream provides a robust platform for real-time chain data processing and visualization.

The project aims to make it easier for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to access, store, and analyze Crypto chain data efficiently. At this moment we're focusing on Bitcoin blockchain and will later expand.

# How does Xstream work?

Xstream uses technologies such as Python, TimescaleDB and Grafana to have real-time blockchain data flowing to the dashboard, see the diagram below:
